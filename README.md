# Aim
To write a Python program that defines a function which accepts three values and returns their mean value.

# Procedure
1. Define a function that accepts three parameters.
2. Calculate the sum of the three values.
3. Divide the sum by 3 to get the mean value.
4. Return the calculated mean value.
5. Call the function and pass three values to it.
6. Print the mean value.

# Output
