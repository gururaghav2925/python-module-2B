# python program to compute the factorial for a Given Number
# Aim
To write a Python program that defines a function which accepts three values and returns their mean value.

# Procedure
1. Define a function that accepts three parameters.
2. Calculate the sum of the three values.
3. Divide the sum by 3 to get the mean value.
4. Return the calculated mean value.
5. Call the function and pass three values to it.
6. Print the mean value.

# Program
```python
def calculate_mean(a, b, c):
    mean = (a + b + c) / 3
    return mean

# Example usage
value1 = 10
value2 = 20
value3 = 30
mean_value = calculate_mean(value1, value2, value3)
print("The mean value is:", mean_value)
```


## Output

# Result
The program successfully computes the mean value of the three input numbers.
